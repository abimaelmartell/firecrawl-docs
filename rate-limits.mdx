## Concurrent Browser Limits

Concurrent browsers represent how many web pages Firecrawl can process for you at the same time.
Your plan determines how many of these jobs can run simultaneously - if you exceed this limit,
additional jobs will wait in a queue until resources become available.

This is typically the primary bottleneck for most users and determines your actual throughput.

| Plan       | Concurrent Browsers |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| Free       | 2                           |
| Hobby      | 5                           |
| Standard   | 50                          |
| Growth     | 100                         |

## FIRE-1 Agent Rate Limits

FIRE-1 agent requests have separate rate limits that are counted independently for each endpoint:

| Endpoint   | Rate Limit (requests/min) |
|------------|---------------------------|
| `/scrape`  | 10                        |
| `/extract` | 10                        |

Note: Scrape FIRE-1 and Extract FIRE-1 are separate rate limits, meaning they are counted separately for each endpoint.

## Standard API Rate Limits

The following rate limits apply to standard API requests and are primarily in place to prevent abuse:

| Plan       | /scrape (requests/min) | /map (requests/min) | /crawl (requests/min) | /search (requests/min) |
|------------|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Free       | 10                     | 10                 | 1                     | 5                      |
| Hobby      | 100                    | 100                | 15                    | 50                     |
| Standard        | 500                    | 500                | 50                    | 250                    |
| Growth | 5000                   | 5000               | 250                   | 2500                   |



|        | /crawl/status (requests/min) |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| Default    | 1500                         |

These rate limits are enforced to ensure fair usage and availability of the API for all users. If you require higher limits, please contact us at [hello@firecrawl.com](mailto:hello@firecrawl.com) to discuss custom plans.

### Batch Endpoints

Batch endpoints follow the /crawl rate limit.

## Extract

| Plan      | /extract (requests/min) |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Free      | 10                     |
| Starter     | 100                    |
| Explorer  | 500                    |
| Pro    | 1000                   |
| Enterprise | Custom                  |

|        | /extract/status (requests/min) |
|--------|--------------------------------|
| Free | 500                       |

## Legacy Plans

| Plan             | /scrape (requests/min) | /crawl (concurrent req) | /search (requests/min) |
|------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Starter          | 100                    | 15                      | 100                    |
| Standard Legacy  | 200                    | 200                     | 200                    |
| Scaled Legacy    | 250                    | 100                    | 250                    |
