FIRE-1 is an AI agent that enhances Firecrawl's scraping capabilities. It can controls browser actions and navigates complex website structures to enable comprehensive data extraction beyond traditional scraping methods.

### What FIRE-1 Can Do:
- Plan and take actions to uncover data
- Interact with buttons, links, inputs, and dynamic elements.
- Get mulitple pages of data that require pagination, multiple steps, etc.

## Extract vs FIRE-1: When to Use Which

Understanding the difference between Firecrawl's **Extract** endpoint and the **FIRE-1** agent is crucial for choosing the right tool for your data extraction needs.

### Extract Endpoint (`/v1/extract`)
The Extract endpoint is designed for **structured data extraction** using LLMs with schemas or prompts:
- **Best for**: Static content that doesn't require interaction
- **Use cases**: Extracting product details, article content, contact information from standard web pages
- **Pricing**: Token-based billing (see [Extract pricing](https://www.firecrawl.dev/extract#pricing))
- **Speed**: Fast processing for straightforward extraction tasks
- **Limitations**: Cannot interact with dynamic elements, buttons, or handle complex navigation

### FIRE-1 Agent
FIRE-1 is an **AI agent** that performs intelligent browser navigation and interaction before extraction:
- **Best for**: Complex sites requiring interaction, navigation, or multi-step processes
- **Use cases**: Paginated content, sites behind login walls, dynamic content that loads after user interaction
- **Pricing**: ~8x more expensive than standard extract due to interaction complexity
- **Speed**: Slower due to browser automation and interaction steps
- **Capabilities**: Can click buttons, fill forms, navigate pagination, handle dynamic content

### When to Choose Each

**Use Extract when:**
- Content is readily available on the page without interaction
- You need fast, cost-effective data extraction
- Working with static HTML content
- Extracting from multiple URLs in bulk

**Use FIRE-1 when:**
- Content requires clicking "Load More" buttons or pagination
- Data is behind forms or interactive elements
- Site uses heavy JavaScript that loads content dynamically
- You need to navigate through multiple steps to reach the data

### Combining Both
You can enhance Extract with FIRE-1 by adding the `agent` parameter to your extract requests, giving you the best of both worlds - intelligent navigation with structured extraction.

## How to Enable FIRE-1

Activating FIRE-1 is straightforward. Simply include an `agent` object in your scrape API request:

```json
"agent": {
  "model": "FIRE-1",
  "prompt": "Your detailed navigation instructions here."
}
```

*Note:* The `prompt` field is required for scrape requests, instructing FIRE-1 precisely how to interact with the webpage. For `/extract` it will use the prompt provided in the `prompt` parameter on the body of the request so you can omit the above `agent.prompt` field.



## Example Usage with Scrape Endpoint

Here's a quick example using FIRE-1 with the scrape endpoint to get the companies on the consumer space from Y Combinator:

<CodeGroup>

<ScrapeFire1Python />
<ScrapeFire1Node />
<ScrapeFire1CURL />

</CodeGroup>

In this scenario, FIRE-1 intelligently clicks the W22 button, the Consumer space button and scrapes the companies.


## Using FIRE-1 with the Extract Endpoint

Similarly, you can leverage the FIRE-1 agent with the `/v1/extract` endpoint for complex extraction tasks that require navigation across multiple pages or interaction with elements.

**Example:**

<CodeGroup>

<ExtractFire1Python />
<ExtractFire1Node />
<ExtractFire1CURL />

</CodeGroup>

## Billing

During this experimental phase:
* `/scrape`: 150 credits 
* `/extract`: See our [token calculator](https://www.firecrawl.dev/pricing?extract-pricing=true#token-calculator). Around 8x the cost of non-agent extract.

## Rate limits

* `/scrape`: 10 requests per minute
* `/extract`: 10 requests per minute
