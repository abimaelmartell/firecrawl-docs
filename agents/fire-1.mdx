FIRE-1 is an AI agent that enhances Firecrawl's scraping capabilities. It can controls browser actions and navigates complex website structures to enable comprehensive data extraction beyond traditional scraping methods.

### What FIRE-1 Can Do:
- Plan and take actions to uncover data
- Interact with buttons, links, inputs, and dynamic elements.
- Get mulitple pages of data that require pagination, multiple steps, etc.



## How to Enable FIRE-1

Activating FIRE-1 is straightforward. Simply include an `agent` object in your scrape API request:

```json
"agent": {
  "model": "FIRE-1",
  "prompt": "Your detailed navigation instructions here."
}
```

*Note:* The `prompt` field is required for scrape requests, instructing FIRE-1 precisely how to interact with the webpage. For `/extract` it will use the prompt provided in the `prompt` parameter on the body of the request so you can omit the above `agent.prompt` field.



## Example Usage with Scrape Endpoint

Here's a quick example using FIRE-1 with the scrape endpoint to get the companies on the consumer space from Y Combinator:

<CodeGroup>

<ScrapeFire1Python />
<ScrapeFire1Node />
<ScrapeFire1CURL />

</CodeGroup>

In this scenario, FIRE-1 intelligently clicks the W22 button, the Consumer space button and scrapes the companies.


## Using FIRE-1 with the Extract Endpoint

Similarly, you can leverage the FIRE-1 agent with the `/v1/extract` endpoint for complex extraction tasks that require navigation across multiple pages or interaction with elements.

**Example:**

<CodeGroup>

<ExtractFire1Python />
<ExtractFire1Node />
<ExtractFire1CURL />

</CodeGroup>

> FIRE-1 is already live and available under preview.

## Billing


| Endpoint   | Base Cost                | Agent Cost (Preview)         | Notes                                      |
|------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `/scrape`  | 150 credits per page     | 0â€“900 agent credits per page | Varies by task complexity.                 |
| `/extract` | See token calculator     | ~8x non-agent extract        | Uses token-based pricing.                  |

- **Why is FIRE-1 more expensive?**  
  FIRE-1 leverages advanced browser automation and AI planning to interact with complex web pages, which requires more compute resources than standard extraction.

> **Note:** FIRE-1 is currently in preview. Pricing and limits may change. For the latest details on `/extract` costs, see our [token calculator](https://www.firecrawl.dev/pricing?extract-pricing=true#token-calculator).

## Rate limits

* `/scrape`: 10 requests per minute
* `/extract`: 10 requests per minute
