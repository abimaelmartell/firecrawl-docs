FIRE-1 is an AI agent that enhances Firecrawl's scraping capabilities. It can controls browser actions and navigates complex website structures to enable comprehensive data extraction beyond traditional scraping methods.

### What FIRE-1 Can Do:
- Plan and take actions to uncover data
- Interact with buttons, links, inputs, and dynamic elements.
- Get mulitple pages of data that require pagination, multiple steps, etc.

## Using FIRE-1 with Extract and Scrape Endpoints

FIRE-1 is an **AI agent enhancement** that can be added to both Firecrawl's `/extract` and `/scrape` endpoints to handle complex navigation and interaction scenarios.

### Base Endpoints

**`/v1/extract` Endpoint:**
- Designed for structured data extraction using LLMs with schemas or prompts
- Best for: Static content extraction from single or multiple URLs
- Pricing: Token-based billing (see [Extract pricing](https://www.firecrawl.dev/extract#pricing))

**`/v1/scrape` Endpoint:**
- Designed for converting web pages to clean, readable formats
- Best for: Getting page content in markdown, HTML, or other formats
- Pricing: Credit-based billing

### Adding FIRE-1 Enhancement

**When to add FIRE-1 to `/extract` or `/scrape`:**
- Content requires clicking "Load More" buttons or pagination
- Data is behind forms or interactive elements  
- Site uses heavy JavaScript that loads content dynamically
- You need to navigate through multiple steps to reach the data
- Content is behind login walls or requires user interaction

**FIRE-1 Enhanced Capabilities:**
- Can click buttons, fill forms, navigate pagination
- Handles dynamic content that loads after user interaction
- Plans and takes actions to uncover hidden data
- Interacts with complex website structures

### Pricing with FIRE-1
- **`/scrape` + FIRE-1**: 150 credits per request
- **`/extract` + FIRE-1**: ~8x the cost of standard extract (see [token calculator](https://www.firecrawl.dev/pricing?extract-pricing=true#token-calculator))

### How to Enable FIRE-1
Simply add the `agent` parameter to your `/extract` or `/scrape` requests to enable FIRE-1 enhancement.

## How to Enable FIRE-1

Activating FIRE-1 is straightforward. Simply include an `agent` object in your scrape API request:

```json
"agent": {
  "model": "FIRE-1",
  "prompt": "Your detailed navigation instructions here."
}
```

*Note:* The `prompt` field is required for scrape requests, instructing FIRE-1 precisely how to interact with the webpage. For `/extract` it will use the prompt provided in the `prompt` parameter on the body of the request so you can omit the above `agent.prompt` field.



## Example Usage with Scrape Endpoint

Here's a quick example using FIRE-1 with the scrape endpoint to get the companies on the consumer space from Y Combinator:

<CodeGroup>

<ScrapeFire1Python />
<ScrapeFire1Node />
<ScrapeFire1CURL />

</CodeGroup>

In this scenario, FIRE-1 intelligently clicks the W22 button, the Consumer space button and scrapes the companies.


## Using FIRE-1 with the Extract Endpoint

Similarly, you can leverage the FIRE-1 agent with the `/v1/extract` endpoint for complex extraction tasks that require navigation across multiple pages or interaction with elements.

**Example:**

<CodeGroup>

<ExtractFire1Python />
<ExtractFire1Node />
<ExtractFire1CURL />

</CodeGroup>

> FIRE-1 is already live and available under preview.

## Billing

During this experimental phase:
* `/scrape`: 150 credits 
* `/extract`: See our [token calculator](https://www.firecrawl.dev/pricing?extract-pricing=true#token-calculator). Around 8x the cost of non-agent extract.

## Rate limits

* `/scrape`: 10 requests per minute
* `/extract`: 10 requests per minute
