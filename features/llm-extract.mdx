## Scrape and extract structured data with Firecrawl

{/* <Warning>Scrape LLM Extract will be deprecated in future versions. Please use the new [Extract](/features/extract) endpoint.</Warning> */}

Firecrawl uses AI to get structured data from web pages in 3 steps:

1. **Set the Schema:**
   Tell us what data you want by defining a JSON schema (using OpenAI's format) along with the webpage URL.

2. **Make the Request:**
   Send your URL and schema to our scrape endpoint. See how here:
   [Scrape Endpoint Documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/endpoint/scrape)

3. **Get Your Data:**
   Get back clean, structured data matching your schema that you can use right away.

This makes getting web data in the format you need quick and easy.

Used to extract structured data from scraped pages.

<CodeGroup>

<ExtractPython />
