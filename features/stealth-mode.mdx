Firecrawl provides different proxy types to help you scrape websites with varying levels of anti-bot protection. The proxy type can be specified using the `proxy` parameter.

### Proxy Types

Firecrawl supports three types of proxies:

- **basic**: Proxies for scraping sites with none to basic anti-bot solutions. Fast and usually works.
- **stealth**: Stealth proxies for scraping sites with advanced anti-bot solutions. Slower, but more reliable on certain sites.
- **auto**: Firecrawl will automatically retry scraping with stealth proxies if the basic proxy fails. If the retry with stealth is successful, 5 credits will be billed for the scrape. If the first attempt with basic is successful, only the regular cost will be billed.

If you do not specify a proxy, Firecrawl will default to basic.

### Using Stealth Mode

When scraping websites with advanced anti-bot protection, you can use the stealth proxy mode to improve your success rate.

<ProxyPython />

<ProxyNode />

<ProxyCURL />

**Note:** Stealth proxy requests cost 5 credits per request when used.

## Using Stealth as a Retry Mechanism

A common pattern is to first try scraping with the default proxy settings, and then retry with stealth mode if you encounter specific error status codes (401, 403, or 500) in the `metadata.statusCode` field of the response. These status codes can be indicative of the website blocking your request.

<ProxyRetryPython />

<ProxyRetryNode />

<ProxyRetryCURL />

</CodeGroup>

This approach allows you to optimize your credit usage by only using stealth mode when necessary.
