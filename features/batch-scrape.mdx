## Batch scraping multiple URLs

You can now batch scrape multiple URLs at the same time. It takes the starting URLs and optional parameters as arguments. The params argument allows you to specify additional options for the batch scrape job, such as the output formats.

### How it works

It is very similar to how the `/crawl` endpoint works. You can either start the batch and wait for completion, or start it and handle completion yourself.

- `batchScrape` (JS) / `batch_scrape` (Python): starts a batch job and waits for it to complete, returning the results.
- `startBatchScrape` (JS) / `start_batch_scrape` (Python): starts a batch job and returns the job ID so you can poll or use webhooks.

### Usage

<CodeGroup>

<BatchScrapePython />
<BatchScrapeNode />
<BatchScrapeCURL />

</CodeGroup>

### Response

- Calling `batchScrape`/`batch_scrape` returns the full results when the batch completes.

<BatchScrapeOutput />
`
- Calling `startBatchScrape`/`start_batch_scrape` returns a job ID you can track via `getBatchScrapeStatus`/`get_batch_scrape_status`, using the API endpoint `/batch/scrape/{id}`, or webhooks. This endpoint is intended for in-progress checks or immediately after completion, **as batch jobs expire after 24 hours**.

## Batch scrape with structured extraction

You can also use the batch scrape endpoint to extract structured data from the pages. This is useful if you want to get the same structured data from a list of URLs.

<CodeGroup>

<BatchScrapeExtractPython />
<BatchScrapeExtractNode />
<BatchScrapeExtractCURL />

</CodeGroup>

### Response

- `batchScrape`/`batch_scrape` returns full results:

<BatchScrapeExtractOutput />

- `startBatchScrape`/`start_batch_scrape` returns a job ID:

<BatchScrapeExtractAsyncOutput />

## Batch scrape with webhooks

You can configure webhooks to receive real-time notifications as each URL in your batch is scraped. This allows you to process results immediately instead of waiting for the entire batch to complete.

<BatchScrapeWebhookCURL />

For comprehensive webhook documentation including event types, payload structure, and implementation examples, see the [Webhooks documentation](/features/webhooks).

### Quick Reference

**Event Types:**
- `batch_scrape.started` - When the batch scrape begins
- `batch_scrape.page` - For each URL successfully scraped  
- `batch_scrape.completed` - When all URLs are processed
- `batch_scrape.failed` - If the batch scrape encounters an error

**Basic Payload:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "type": "batch_scrape.page",
  "id": "batch-job-id",
  "data": [...], // Page data for 'page' events
  "metadata": {}, // Your custom metadata
  "error": null
}
```
