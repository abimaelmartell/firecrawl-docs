Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications about your Firecrawl operations as they progress. Instead of polling for status updates, Firecrawl will automatically send HTTP POST requests to your specified endpoint when events occur.

## Supported Operations

Webhooks are supported for most major Firecrawl operations:

- **Crawl** - Get notified as pages are crawled and when crawls complete
- **Batch scrape** - Receive updates for each URL scraped in a batch
- **Extract** - Receive updates when extract jobs start, complete, or fail

## Quick Setup

Configure webhooks by adding a `webhook` object to your request:

<WebhookConfigBasic />

### Configuration Options

| Field      | Type   | Required | Description                                   |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `url`      | string | ✅       | Your webhook endpoint URL                     |
| `headers`  | object | ❌       | Custom headers to include in webhook requests |
| `metadata` | object | ❌       | Custom data included in all webhook payloads  |
| `events`   | array  | ❌       | Event types to receive (default: all events)  |

## Basic Usage Examples

### Crawl with Webhook

<CrawlWebhookCURL />

### Batch Scrape with Webhook

<BatchScrapeWebhookCURL />

## Handling Webhooks

Here's a simple example of handling webhooks in your application:

<CodeGroup>

<WebhookSignatureJS />

<WebhookSignaturePython />

</CodeGroup>

### Best Practices

1. **Respond quickly** – Always return a `2xx` status code within 30 seconds
2. **Process asynchronously** – For heavy processing, queue the work and respond immediately
3. **Validate authenticity** – Always verify the webhook signature (see [Security](/features/webhooks/security))
