## How It Works

Firecrawl caches previously scraped pages and, by default, returns a recent copy when available.

- **Default freshness**: `maxAge = 172800000` ms (2 days). If the cached copy is newer than this, it’s returned instantly; otherwise, Firecrawl scrapes fresh and updates the cache.
- **Force fresh**: Set `maxAge: 0` to always scrape.
- **Skip caching**: Set `storeInCache: false` if you don’t want to store results for a request.

Get your results **up to 500% faster** when you don’t need the absolute freshest data. Control freshness via `maxAge`:

1. **Return instantly** if we have a recent version of the page
2. **Scrape fresh** only if our version is older than your specified age
3. **Save you time** - results come back in milliseconds instead of seconds

## When to Use This

**Great for:**

- Documentation, articles, product pages
- Bulk processing jobs
- Development and testing
- Building knowledge bases

**Skip for:**

- Real-time data (stock prices, live scores, breaking news)
- Frequently updated content
- Time-sensitive applications

## Usage

Add `maxAge` to your scrape request. Values are in milliseconds (e.g., `3600000` = 1 hour).

<CodeGroup>

<FastScrapePython />

<FastScrapeNode />

</CodeGroup>

## Common maxAge values

Here are some helpful reference values:

- **5 minutes**: `300000` - For semi-dynamic content
- **1 hour**: `3600000` - For content that updates hourly
- **1 day**: `86400000` - For daily-updated content
- **1 week**: `604800000` - For relatively static content

## Performance impact

With `maxAge` enabled:

- **500% faster response times** for recent content
- **Instant results** instead of waiting for fresh scrapes

## Important notes

- **Default**: `maxAge` is `172800000` (2 days)
- **Fresh when needed**: If our data is older than `maxAge`, we scrape fresh automatically
- **No stale data**: You'll never get data older than your specified `maxAge`

## Faster crawling

The same speed benefits apply when crawling multiple pages. Use `maxAge` within `scrapeOptions` to get cached results for pages we’ve seen recently.

<FastCrawlPython />
<FastCrawlNode />
<FastCrawlCURL />

</CodeGroup>

When crawling with `maxAge`, each page in your crawl will benefit from the 500% speed improvement if we have recent cached data for that page.

Start using `maxAge` today for dramatically faster scrapes and crawls!
