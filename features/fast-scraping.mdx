# Lightning-Fast Scraping with Caching

Get your scraping results **500% faster** by using Firecrawl's intelligent caching system. When you don't need the absolute freshest data, caching can dramatically speed up your scrapes while saving you credits.

## How It Works

Firecrawl now maintains an index of previously scraped pages. When you enable caching with the `maxAge` parameter, Firecrawl will:

1. **Check the cache first** - If we have a recent version of the page, return it instantly
2. **Scrape only when needed** - If the cached version is older than your specified age, we'll scrape fresh content
3. **Save you time and credits** - Cached results are returned in milliseconds instead of seconds

## When to Use Caching

**Perfect for:**
- Content that doesn't change frequently (documentation, articles, product pages)
- Bulk processing where slight delays in freshness are acceptable
- Development and testing scenarios
- Building knowledge bases or RAG systems

**Skip caching for:**
- Real-time data (stock prices, live scores, breaking news)
- User-generated content that updates frequently
- Time-sensitive applications

## Usage

Simply add the `maxAge` parameter to your scrape request. The value is in milliseconds - for example, `3600000` means "use cached data if it's less than 1 hour old."

## Common maxAge Values

Here are some helpful reference values:

- **5 minutes**: `300000` - For semi-dynamic content
- **1 hour**: `3600000` - For content that updates hourly
- **1 day**: `86400000` - For daily-updated content
- **1 week**: `604800000` - For relatively static content

## Performance Impact

With caching enabled, you can expect:

- **500% faster response times** for cached content
- **Reduced credit usage** - cached results don't consume scraping credits
- **Lower server load** - helping maintain consistent performance for all users

## Important Notes

- **Default behavior**: `maxAge` defaults to `0`, which disables caching entirely
- **Fresh scrapes**: When cached data is older than `maxAge`, a fresh scrape is performed automatically
- **No stale data**: You'll never receive data older than your specified `maxAge`
- **Credit efficiency**: Only fresh scrapes consume credits - cached results are free

Start using `maxAge` in your scraping workflows today and experience dramatically faster data retrieval!
