Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications about your Firecrawl operations as they progress. Instead of polling for status updates, Firecrawl will automatically send HTTP POST requests to your specified endpoint when events occur.

## Overview

Webhooks are supported for:
- **Crawl operations** - Get notified as pages are crawled and when crawls complete
- **Batch scrape operations** - Receive updates for each URL scraped in a batch

## Basic Configuration

Configure webhooks by adding a `webhook` object to your request:

<WebhookConfigBasic />

### Configuration Options

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `url` | string | ✅ | Your webhook endpoint URL |
| `headers` | object | ❌ | Custom headers to include in webhook requests |
| `metadata` | object | ❌ | Custom data included in all webhook payloads |
| `events` | array | ❌ | Event types to receive (default: all events) |

## Event Types

### Crawl Events

| Event | Description | When Triggered |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| `crawl.started` | Crawl job initiated | When crawl begins |
| `crawl.page` | Individual page scraped | After each page is successfully scraped |
| `crawl.completed` | Crawl finished successfully | When all pages are processed |
| `crawl.failed` | Crawl encountered an error | When crawl fails or is cancelled |

### Batch Scrape Events

| Event | Description | When Triggered |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| `batch_scrape.started` | Batch scrape job initiated | When batch scrape begins |
| `batch_scrape.page` | Individual URL scraped | After each URL is successfully scraped |
| `batch_scrape.completed` | Batch scrape finished | When all URLs are processed |
| `batch_scrape.failed` | Batch scrape failed | When batch scrape fails or is cancelled |

## Webhook Payload Structure

All webhook payloads follow this structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "type": "crawl.page",
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "data": [...],
  "metadata": {
    "user_id": "12345",
    "project": "web-scraping"
  },
  "error": null,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Payload Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `success` | boolean | Whether the operation was successful |
| `type` | string | Event type (e.g., `crawl.page`, `batch_scrape.completed`) |
| `id` | string | Unique identifier for the crawl/batch scrape job |
| `data` | array | Scraped content (populated for `page` events) |
| `metadata` | object | Custom metadata from your webhook configuration |
| `error` | string | Error message (present when `success` is `false`) |
| `timestamp` | string | ISO 8601 timestamp of when the event occurred |

## Examples

### Crawl with Webhook

<CrawlWebhookCURL />

### Batch Scrape with Webhook

<BatchScrapeWebhookCURL />

### Webhook Endpoint Example

Here's how to handle webhooks in your application:

<CodeGroup>

<WebhookEndpointJS />

<WebhookEndpointPython />

</CodeGroup>

## Event-Specific Payloads

### `started` Events

<WebhookPayloadStarted />

### `page` Events

<WebhookPayloadPage />

### `completed` Events

<WebhookPayloadCompleted />

### `failed` Events

<WebhookPayloadFailed />

## Webhook Security

Firecrawl signs every webhook request using **HMAC-SHA256**, generated with your account's secret (available in your account settings).

### Signature Header

Each request includes an `X-Firecrawl-Signature` header with the following format:

```
X-Firecrawl-Signature: sha256=[signature]
```

### Verifying Signatures

To verify a webhook:
1. Compute the HMAC-SHA256 digest of the raw request body using your secret key.
2. Compare it against the value in the `X-Firecrawl-Signature` header.
3. Use a timing-safe comparison to avoid leaking information.

<CodeGroup>

<WebhookSignatureJS />

<WebhookSignaturePython />

</CodeGroup>

### Security Best Practices

1. **Verify all signatures** - Never process a webhook without verifying its signature.  
2. **Use constant-time comparison** - Functions like `crypto.timingSafeEqual()` (Node.js) or `hmac.compare_digest()` (Python) protect against timing attacks.  
3. **Require HTTPS** - Only accept webhooks over HTTPS.  

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Testing Your Webhook

Use tools like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) for local development:

```bash
# Expose local server
ngrok http 3000

# Use the ngrok URL in your webhook configuration
# https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhook
```

### Webhook Logs

Monitor webhook delivery in your application:

```javascript
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  console.log('Webhook received:', {
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    type: req.body.type,
    id: req.body.id,
    success: req.body.success
  });
  
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

## Common Issues

### Webhook Not Receiving Events

1. **Check URL accessibility** - Ensure your endpoint is publicly accessible
2. **Verify HTTPS** - Webhook URLs must use HTTPS
3. **Check firewall settings** - Allow incoming connections to your webhook port
4. **Review event filters** - Ensure you're subscribed to the correct event types
