This page covers all the different types of webhook events that Firecrawl can send to your endpoint. Each event type corresponds to a different stage in your scraping operations.

## Event Structure

All webhook events follow this basic structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "type": "crawl.page",
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "data": [...],
  "metadata": {}
}
```

### Common Fields

| Field      | Type    | Description                                       |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `success`  | boolean | Whether the operation was successful              |
| `type`     | string  | Event type identifier                             |
| `id`       | string  | Unique identifier for the job                     |
| `data`     | array   | Event-specific data (varies by event type)        |
| `metadata` | object  | Custom metadata from your webhook configuration   |
| `error`    | string  | Error message (present when `success` is `false`) |

## Crawl Events

Multi-page crawling operations that follow links.

### `crawl.started`

Sent when a crawl operation begins.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "type": "crawl.started",
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "data": [],
  "metadata": {}
}
```

### `crawl.page`

Sent for each individual page that gets scraped during a crawl.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "type": "crawl.page",
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "data": [
    {
      "markdown": "# Welcome to our website\n\nThis is the main content of the page...",
      "metadata": {
        "title": "Page Title",
        "description": "Page description",
        "url": "https://example.com/page",
        "statusCode": 200,
        "contentType": "text/html",

## Event Filtering

```json
{
  "url": "https://your-app.com/webhook",
  "events": ["completed", "failed"]
}
```
