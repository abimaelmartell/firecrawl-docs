> Note: A new [v2 version of this API](/api-reference/endpoint/search) is now available with improved features and performance.

The search endpoint combines web search (SERP) with Firecrawl's scraping capabilities to return full page content for any query.

Include `scrapeOptions` with `formats: ["markdown"]` to get complete markdown content for each search result otherwise you will default to getting the SERP results (url, title, description).

## Supported query operators
We support a variety of query operators that allow you to filter your searches better.

| Operator | Functionality | Examples |
---|-|-|
| `""` | Non-fuzzy matches a string of text | `"Firecrawl"`
| `-` | Excludes certain keywords or negates other operators | `-bad`, `-site:firecrawl.dev`
| `site:` | Only returns results from a specified website | `site:firecrawl.dev`
| `inurl:` | Only returns results that include a word in the URL | `inurl:firecrawl`
| `allinurl:` | Only returns results that include multiple words in the URL | `allinurl:git firecrawl`
| `intitle:` | Only returns results that include a word in the title of the page | `intitle:Firecrawl`
| `allintitle:` | Only returns results that include multiple words in the title of the page | `allintitle:firecrawl playground`
| `related:` | Only returns results that are related to a specific domain | `related:firecrawl.dev`
| `imagesize:` | Only returns images with exact dimensions | `imagesize:1920x1080`
| `larger:` | Only returns images larger than specified dimensions | `larger:1920x1080`

## Location Parameter
