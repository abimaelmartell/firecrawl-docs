### Smarter Extraction

FIRE-1 agent handles tricky websites:

- Auto-clicks through pages and pagination
- Works on JavaScript-heavy sites
- Better at finding and extracting data

### No URL Required

Extract data without knowing the exact URL:

- Describe what you want, v2 finds it
- Searches web and extracts from best pages
- More accurate than v1

### Better Performance

- Faster processing
- More reliable error handling
- Higher accuracy

Same API as v1, easy to upgrade.
