## What's New in v2

### Search Multiple Sources

Search web, images, and news at once:

```json
{
  "query": "firecrawl web scraping",
  "sources": [
    { "type": "web", "tbs": "qdr:w", "location": "US" },
    { "type": "images" },
    { "type": "news" }
  ]
}
```

### Response Format Changed

v1: flat list of results. v2: organized by source type:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "web": [
      /* web results */
    ],
    "images": [
      /* image results */
    ],
    "news": [
      /* news results */
    ]
  }
}
```

### New Features

- Filter by time ranges ("past week", "past month")
- Target specific countries/regions
- Results capped at 500 during alpha

The search endpoint combines web search (SERP) with Firecrawl's scraping capabilities to return full page content for any query.

Include `scrapeOptions` with `formats: [{"type": "markdown"}]` to get complete markdown content for each search result otherwise you will default to getting the SERP results (url, title, description). You can also use other formats like `{"type": "summary"}` for condensed content.

## Supported query operators

We support a variety of query operators that allow you to filter your searches better.
