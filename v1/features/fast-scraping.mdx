## How It Works

Get your scraping results **500% faster** when you don't need the absolute freshest data. Firecrawl keeps an index of previously scraped pages. Add the `maxAge` parameter to your request and we'll:

1. **Return instantly** if we have a recent version of the page
2. **Scrape fresh** only if our version is older than your specified age
3. **Save you time** - results come back in milliseconds instead of seconds

## When to Use This

**Great for:**

- Documentation, articles, product pages
- Bulk processing jobs
- Development and testing
- Building knowledge bases

**Skip for:**

- Real-time data (stock prices, live scores, breaking news)
- Frequently updated content
- Time-sensitive applications

## Usage

Simply add the `maxAge` parameter to your scrape request. The value is in milliseconds - for example, `3600000` means "use cached data if it's less than 1 hour old."

## Common maxAge Values

Here are some helpful reference values:

- **5 minutes**: `300000` - For semi-dynamic content
- **1 hour**: `3600000` - For content that updates hourly
- **1 day**: `86400000` - For daily-updated content
- **1 week**: `604800000` - For relatively static content

## Performance Impact

With `maxAge` enabled:

- **500% faster response times** for recent content
- **Instant results** instead of waiting for fresh scrapes

## Important Notes

- **Default**: `maxAge` defaults to `0`, which means always scrape fresh
- **Fresh when needed**: If our data is older than `maxAge`, we scrape fresh automatically
- **No stale data**: You'll never get data older than your specified `maxAge`

## Faster Crawling

The same speed benefits apply when crawling multiple pages. Use `maxAge` within `scrapeOptions` to get cached results for pages we've seen recently.

When crawling with `maxAge`, each page in your crawl will benefit from the 500% speed improvement if we have recent cached data for that page.

Start using `maxAge` today for dramatically faster scrapes and crawls!
