## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does Firecrawl help with website monitoring?">
    Firecrawl extracts website content and structure on demand. Build monitoring
    systems that call Firecrawl's API to check pages, compare extracted data
    against baselines, and trigger your own alerts when changes occur.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I monitor JavaScript-heavy applications?">
    Yes! Firecrawl fully renders JavaScript, making it perfect for monitoring
    modern SPAs, React apps, and dynamic content. We capture the page as users
    see it, not just the raw HTML.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How quickly can I detect website issues?">
    Firecrawl extracts data in real-time when called. Build your monitoring
    system to check sites at whatever frequency you need - from minute-by-minute
    for critical pages to daily for routine checks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I validate specific page elements?">
    Yes. Use the extract API to pull specific elements like prices, inventory
    levels, or critical content. Build validation logic in your monitoring
    system to verify that important information is present and correct.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I integrate Firecrawl with alerting systems?">
    Firecrawl provides webhooks that you can use to build integrations with your
    alerting tools. Send extracted data to PagerDuty, Slack, email, or any
    monitoring platform by building connectors that process Firecrawl's
    responses.
