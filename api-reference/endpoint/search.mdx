The search endpoint combines web search (SERP) with Firecrawl's scraping capabilities to return full page content for any query.

Include `scrapeOptions` with `formats: ["markdown"]` to get complete markdown content for each search result otherwise you will default to getting the SERP results (url, title, description).

## Pricing Model

The search endpoint uses a flexible pricing structure:

### Base Search Cost
- **1 credit per search result** (controlled by the `limit` parameter)
- Example: `limit: 5` = 5 credits for the search operation

### Content Scraping Options
- **Search-only**: When `scrapeOptions.formats` is empty or undefined, only basic SERP results are returned with no additional scraping costs
- **Content scraping**: When formats are specified, each result URL is scraped and billed as 1 additional credit per URL
- **Blocked sites inclusion**: Omit `scrapeOptions` entirely to include sites that are normally blocked from scraping in search results

### PDF Handling
- **Default (`parsePDF: true`)**: 1 credit per PDF page when scraping PDF results
- **Optimized (`parsePDF: false`)**: 1 credit total per PDF document when scraping PDF results

### Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Control result count**: Use the `limit` parameter to control base search costs
2. **Avoid unnecessary scraping**: Use empty `formats` array to get only search results without content scraping
3. **Include blocked sites**: Omit `scrapeOptions` entirely to include normally blocked sites in search results
4. **Optimize PDF costs**: Set `parsePDF: false` for flat-rate PDF billing instead of per-page charges
