The search endpoint combines web search (SERP) with Firecrawl's scraping capabilities to return full page content for any query.

Include `scrapeOptions` with `formats: ["markdown"]` to get complete markdown content for each search result otherwise you will default to getting the SERP results (url, title, description).

## Pricing Model

The search endpoint uses a flexible pricing structure based on your scraping options:

- **Search-only**: When `scrapeOptions.formats` is empty or undefined, only basic SERP results are returned with no additional scraping costs
- **Content scraping**: When formats are specified, each result URL is scraped and billed as 1 credit per URL
- **PDF handling**: 
  - `parsePDF: true` (default): 1 credit per PDF page
  - `parsePDF: false`: 1 credit total per PDF document

### Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Avoid unnecessary scraping**: Use empty `formats` array to get only search results without content scraping
2. **Optimize PDF costs**: Set `parsePDF: false` for flat-rate PDF billing instead of per-page charges
