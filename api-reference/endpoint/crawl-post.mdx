## What's New in v2

### Tell crawl what you want

Describe what to crawl in plain English:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "prompt": "Only crawl blog posts and docs, skip marketing pages"
}
```

This will map the prompt to a set of crawler settings to perform the crawl.

### Improved Sitemap Control

In v1, sitemap usage was a boolean. In v2, the `sitemap` option lets you choose:

- `"include"` (default): Use the sitemap and also discover other pages.
- `"skip"`: Ignore the sitemap entirely.

### New Crawling Options

- `crawlEntireDomain` - Crawl whole domain, not just child pages
- `maxDiscoveryDepth` - Control crawl depth (replaces `maxDepth`)

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/features",
  "crawlEntireDomain": true,
  "maxDiscoveryDepth": 2,
  "sitemap": "include"
}
```
