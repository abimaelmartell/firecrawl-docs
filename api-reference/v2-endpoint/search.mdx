## What's New in v2

### Multiple Search Source Types
The v2 Search API introduces support for multiple source types through the `sources` parameter:

**Available Source Types:**
- **web**: Traditional web search results with time-based filtering
- **images**: Image search results  
- **news**: News article search results

```json
{
  "query": "firecrawl web scraping",
  "sources": [
    {
      "type": "web",
      "tbs": "qdr:w",
      "location": "US"
    },
    {
      "type": "images"
    },
    {
      "type": "news"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Enhanced Response Structure
**v1 Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [/* flat array of results */]
}
```

**v2 Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "web": [/* web search results */],
    "images": [/* image search results */],
    "news": [/* news search results */]
  }
}
```

### Advanced Search Parameters
- **Time-based filtering**: Support for `tbs` parameter with predefined ranges (`qdr:h`, `qdr:d`, `qdr:w`, `qdr:m`, `qdr:y`) and custom date ranges
- **Location targeting**: Enhanced location parameter for geo-specific results
- **Smart search functionality**: During Alpha phase, limited to 500 search results with intelligent result processing

The search endpoint combines web search (SERP) with Firecrawl's scraping capabilities to return full page content for any query.

Include `scrapeOptions` with `formats: ["markdown"]` to get complete markdown content for each search result otherwise you will default to getting the SERP results (url, title, description).

## Supported query operators
We support a variety of query operators that allow you to filter your searches better.

| Operator | Functionality | Examples |
---|-|-|
| `""` | Non-fuzzy matches a string of text | `"Firecrawl"`
| `-` | Excludes certain keywords or negates other operators | `-bad`, `-site:firecrawl.dev`
| `site:` | Only returns results from a specified website | `site:firecrawl.dev`
| `inurl:` | Only returns results that include a word in the URL | `inurl:firecrawl`
| `allinurl:` | Only returns results that include multiple words in the URL | `allinurl:git firecrawl`
| `intitle:` | Only returns results that include a word in the title of the page | `intitle:Firecrawl`
| `allintitle:` | Only returns results that include multiple words in the title of the page | `allintitle:firecrawl playground`
| `related:` | Only returns results that are related to a specific domain | `related:firecrawl.dev`

## Location Parameter

Use the `location` parameter to get geo-targeted search results. Format: `"string"`. Examples: `"Germany"`, `"San Francisco,California,United States"`.

See the [complete list of supported locations](https://firecrawl.dev/search_locations.json) for all available countries and languages.

## Time-Based Search

Use the `tbs` parameter to filter results by time periods, including custom date ranges. See the [Search Feature documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/features/search#time-based-search) for detailed examples and supported formats.
