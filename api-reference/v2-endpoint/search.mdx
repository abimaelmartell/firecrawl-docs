## What's New in v2

### Multiple Search Sources
The v2 Search API now supports multiple source types through the `sources` parameter:
- **web**: Traditional web search results (default)
- **images**: Image search results  
- **news**: News article search results

```json
{
  "query": "firecrawl",
  "sources": [
    {"type": "web"},
    {"type": "images"}, 
    {"type": "news"}
  ]
}
```

### Updated Response Structure
The response structure has changed to organize results by source type:

**v1 Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [/* array of results */]
}
```

**v2 Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "web": [/* web results */],
    "images": [/* image results */],
    "news": [/* news results */]
  }
}
```

The search endpoint combines web search (SERP) with Firecrawl's scraping capabilities to return full page content for any query.

Include `scrapeOptions` with `formats: ["markdown"]` to get complete markdown content for each search result otherwise you will default to getting the SERP results (url, title, description).

## Supported query operators
We support a variety of query operators that allow you to filter your searches better.

| Operator | Functionality | Examples |
---|-|-|
| `""` | Non-fuzzy matches a string of text | `"Firecrawl"`
| `-` | Excludes certain keywords or negates other operators | `-bad`, `-site:firecrawl.dev`
| `site:` | Only returns results from a specified website | `site:firecrawl.dev`
| `inurl:` | Only returns results that include a word in the URL | `inurl:firecrawl`
| `allinurl:` | Only returns results that include multiple words in the URL | `allinurl:git firecrawl`
| `intitle:` | Only returns results that include a word in the title of the page | `intitle:Firecrawl`
| `allintitle:` | Only returns results that include multiple words in the title of the page | `allintitle:firecrawl playground`
| `related:` | Only returns results that are related to a specific domain | `related:firecrawl.dev`

## Location Parameter

Use the `location` parameter to get geo-targeted search results. Format: `"string"`. Examples: `"Germany"`, `"San Francisco,California,United States"`.

See the [complete list of supported locations](https://firecrawl.dev/search_locations.json) for all available countries and languages.

## Time-Based Search

Use the `tbs` parameter to filter results by time periods, including custom date ranges. See the [Search Feature documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/features/search#time-based-search) for detailed examples and supported formats.
