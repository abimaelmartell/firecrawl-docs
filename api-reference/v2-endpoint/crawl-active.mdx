## What's New in v2

### Enhanced Active Crawl Monitoring
The v2 Active Crawls API provides improved visibility into advanced crawling operations:

- **Prompt-based crawl tracking**: Monitor crawls configured with natural language prompts
- **Sitemap mode visibility**: See which crawls are using different sitemap handling modes
- **Discovery depth tracking**: Monitor crawls with `maxDiscoveryDepth` configurations
- **Domain crawling status**: Track `crawlEntireDomain` operations across active crawls

### Advanced Crawl Information
- **Format configuration display**: See which advanced formats are being used
- **Parser operation tracking**: Monitor PDF and other parser operations in active crawls
- **Location-based crawling**: Track crawls using country/language-specific configurations

### Performance Improvements
- **Faster retrieval**: Optimized for monitoring large numbers of concurrent advanced crawls
- **Better resource tracking**: Enhanced visibility into resource usage for complex operations
- **Improved reliability**: Better monitoring for production workloads with advanced features

The API maintains compatibility with v1 while providing enhanced monitoring for all the advanced v2 crawling capabilities.
