## What's New in v2

### Tell the Crawler What You Want
Just describe what you want to crawl in plain English:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "prompt": "Only crawl blog posts and docs, skip marketing pages"
}
```

### Better Sitemap Control
v1 only had on/off for sitemaps. v2 gives you three options:
- `"include"` - Use sitemap + find other pages (default)
- `"skip"` - Ignore the sitemap completely  
- `"only"` - Only crawl what's in the sitemap

### New Crawling Options
- `crawlEntireDomain` - Go beyond just child pages, crawl the whole domain
- `maxDiscoveryDepth` - Control how deep to go (replaces the old `maxDepth`)

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/features",
  "crawlEntireDomain": true,
  "maxDiscoveryDepth": 2,
  "sitemap": "include"
}
```
