- **Parser operations**: Batch PDF processing with the enhanced `parsers` array system
- **Consistent format handling**: All URLs in the batch use the same advanced format configurations

### Enhanced Batch Processing
- **Location-based batching**: Apply country/language-specific proxying to entire batches
- **Advanced proxy management**: Batch operations with stealth/basic/auto proxy modes
- **Enhanced scraping options**: Batch processing with `removeBase64Images`, `blockAds`, and other v2 enhancements

### Performance & Reliability Improvements
- **Optimized batch processing**: Better resource management for complex format configurations
- **Enhanced monitoring**: Improved progress tracking for advanced batch operations
