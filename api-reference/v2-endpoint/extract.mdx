## What's New in v2

### Smarter Extraction
The new FIRE-1 agent can handle tricky websites:
- Automatically clicks through pages and pagination
- Works on JavaScript-heavy sites that load content dynamically
- Much better at finding and extracting the data you want

### No URL Required
You can now extract data without knowing the exact URL:
- Just describe what you're looking for and v2 will find it
- Searches the web and extracts from the best pages
- Way more accurate than v1

### Better Performance
- Faster processing
- More reliable with better error handling
- Higher accuracy overall

The API works the same as v1, so it's easy to upgrade.
