## What's New in v2

### Enhanced Sitemap Modes
v2 Map API introduces three distinct sitemap handling modes:

- `"include"` (default): Use sitemap along with other discovery methods
- `"skip"`: Ignore the website sitemap completely  
- `"only"`: Return only URLs found in the sitemap

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "sitemap": "only"
}
```

### Smart Search Functionality
Enhanced search capabilities for URL discovery:
- **Intelligent filtering**: Smart processing of search results during Alpha phase
- **Scalable discovery**: No limit on results when map finds more than 500 URLs
- **Advanced pattern matching**: Better URL discovery through improved algorithms

### Performance & Reliability Improvements
- **Faster mapping**: Optimized website structure discovery
- **Better accuracy**: Enhanced URL detection and filtering
- **Improved handling**: Better support for complex site architectures

The core API parameters remain compatible with v1 while providing enhanced discovery capabilities.
