## What's New in v2

### Better Sitemap Control
Three ways to handle sitemaps:

- `"include"` - Use sitemap + find other pages (default)
- `"skip"` - Ignore sitemap completely  
- `"only"` - Only return sitemap URLs

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "sitemap": "only"
}
```

### Smarter URL Discovery
- Finds all pages on a website
- No limit on results (v1 capped at 500)
- Faster and more accurate

Same API as v1 but finds more pages, works better on complex sites.
