## What's New in v2

### Better Sitemap Control
v2 gives you three ways to handle sitemaps:

- `"include"` - Use sitemap + find other pages (default)
- `"skip"` - Ignore the sitemap completely  
- `"only"` - Only return URLs from the sitemap

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "sitemap": "only"
}
```

### Smarter URL Discovery
- Better at finding all the pages on a website
- No limit on results (v1 was capped at 500)
- Faster and more accurate

Works the same as v1 but finds more pages and works better on complex websites.
