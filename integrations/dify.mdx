## Sync Data from Websites for Dify workflows

Firecrawl can be used inside of [Dify the LLM workflow builder](https://cloud.dify.ai/). This page introduces how to scrape data from a web page, parse it into Markdown, and import it into the Dify knowledge base using their Firecrawl integration.

### Configuring Firecrawl

First, you need to configure Firecrawl credentials in the Data Source section of the Settings page.

The configuration options include: Whether to crawl sub-pages, Page crawling limit, Page scraping max depth, Excluded paths, Include only paths, and Content extraction scope. After completing the configuration, click Run to preview the parsed pages.
