<Info>
**Pay-Per-Use Search Endpoint**

This endpoint allows you to use Firecrawl's powerful search capabilities without a subscription by paying per search using cryptocurrency. Perfect for one-off searches or testing before committing to a subscription.

</Info>

<Warning>
**Experimental Feature**

This is an experimental endpoint. Features, pricing, and availability may change without notice. We recommend using the standard subscription-based search endpoint for production use cases.

</Warning>

## Authentication

This endpoint requires a special payment header instead of the standard API key:

```
X-Payment: {{paymentHeader}}
```

## How it Works

The On-Demand Search endpoint combines web search (SERP) with Firecrawl's scraping capabilities to return full page content for any query, just like the regular `/search` endpoint, but with pay-per-use pricing.

Include `scrapeOptions` with `formats: ["markdown"]` to get complete markdown content for each search result otherwise you will default to getting the SERP results (url, title, description).

### Request Parameters

All parameters from the standard `/search` endpoint are supported with the following exception:

<Note>
  **Important Limitation**: The `limit` parameter is capped at **10 results
  maximum** for the wallet endpoint (compared to 100 for the standard endpoint).
</Note>

For the complete list of available parameters, supported query operators, and their descriptions, please refer to the [standard Search endpoint documentation](/api-reference/endpoint/search).

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/x402/search \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  -H 'X-Payment: {{paymentHeader}}' \
  -d '{
    "query": "Premier league fixtures for the 2025/26 season",
    "limit": 10,  # Maximum 10 results allowed
    "scrapeOptions": {
      "formats": ["markdown"],
      "onlyMainContent": true
    }
  }'
```

## Response

The response format is identical to the standard `/search` endpoint:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "title": "Page Title",
      "description": "Page description from search result",
      "url": "https://example.com",
      "markdown": "# Page Content\n\nMarkdown content if scraping was requested...",
      "metadata": {
        "title": "Page Title",
        "description": "Meta description",
        "sourceURL": "https://example.com",
        "statusCode": 200
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Pricing

**Current price: $0.01 per request**

<Warning>
  **Pricing Notice**: The current pricing of $0.01 per request is subject to
  change at any time without prior notice. Please check the latest pricing when
  generating your payment header.
</Warning>

Each search request is charged on a pay-per-use basis using cryptocurrency through the payment header system.
